# What is pongstrong?
Pongstrong is a highly specialized web app which was used for a couple of beerpong turnaments organized by a friend of mine.
It is not really useful for anything else. There is actually no way to change how each turnament is played without changing the code itself.
The only input parameters are the players which need to already be ordered in groups of Teams. 

# Obvious Problems
  - all the code is in one 1500 line file
  - progress is only saved every few minutes
  - it runs in a single container 
  - almost zero documentation
